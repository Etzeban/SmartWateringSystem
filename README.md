<h1>Smart Watering System</h1>

 ### [Smart watering system showcase website](https://www.rmitvn-showcase.com/calico)

<h2>Description</h2>
Cooperated in a team of 5 students to build an automated irrigation system for outdoor plants. Responsible for designing 3D CAD model of the water storage system and the water shooting range. I assist the team in practical solutions, assembling, wiring, and designing system layout.
<br />
RMIT Sustainability has requested SSET final-year students to create a "Smart Watering System" as a 2024 capstone project to promote sustainable gardening practices in RMIT's sustainable garden, the Aloe Garden. The watering system should be water-saving, and innovative in setup that can assist garden participants in reducing stress during its use. The technology solution focuses on automated irrigation methods and systems.
The system feature automated controls, sensors, predictive analytics, and remote monitoring to optimize water usage. A key innovation is the water gun shooting mechanism, which triggers the watering process, making garden maintenance both efficient and engaging. This approach conserves water while offering an educational and enjoyable experience for participants.
